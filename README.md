## Features

### Registration and Login
When opening the app, the user can either create a new account or login with their email and password if they already have one.

### Homepage
The homepage displays a variety of pet items, such as food, feeders, waterers, toys, collars, among others. At the top of the screen, there are icon options that represent different types of animals (dog, cat, bird, etc.). By clicking on an icon, options for items related to the chosen animal are displayed so that the user can navigate through different product categories.

### Favorites
Users have the option to add certain items to the "favorites" tab by clicking on the heart icon displayed on each item. This allows the user to save items of interest and come back to them later.

### Product Details

By clicking on an item on the homepage, the user is taken to a page with more detailed information about that product, including images, description, and price. In addition, options are displayed to either buy the item or add it to the cart, as well as the ability to select the desired quantity of the item.

### Cart
In the cart tab, all the items that the user added to the cart are displayed, along with their respective quantities, prices, and the option to delete a specific item from the cart. The total purchase amount of the items in the cart is also shown, along with the option to complete the purchase.
